1)
-Check stock
-Send to repeater
-URL Decode, http://stock.weliketoshop.net:8080/product/stock/check?productId=1&storeId=1
-http://localhost - Doesn't work
-App is looking for a specific host name, stock.weliketoshop.net

2)
-stockApi=http://localhost@stock.weliketoshop.net - Can't connect
-stockApi=http://localhost#@stock.weliketoshop.net - Must be stock...
# is a fragment
-stockApi=http://localhost#@stock.weliketoshop.net - URL encode, Must be stock...
-stockApi=http://localhost%25%323@stock.weliketoshop.net - Double URL encode - works
-stockApi=http://localhost%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin - works
-stockApi=http://localhost%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin/delete?username=carlos
