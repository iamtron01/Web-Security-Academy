stay-logged-in cookie is not set to http only:
The HttpOnly flag on a cookie is a security feature that helps mitigate the risk of client-side
script accessing the protected cookie data. Here's what it does:

-Prevents JavaScript Access:
When the HttpOnly flag is set on a cookie, it cannot be accessed or modified via JavaScript.
This helps protect the cookie from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, where an attacker might
inject malicious scripts to steal cookies.

-Server-Side Access Only:
The cookie is only accessible by the server through HTTP requests (e.g., during form submissions, AJAX requests, etc.).
 This ensures that sensitive information stored in the cookie is not exposed to client-side scripts.

 HTTP response header:
 Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly

 In asp.net the session cookie is set to HttpOnly by default, but **custom cookies are not**
